								<h2>About the founder</h2>
								<p>My name is Robert Nediyakalaparambil. I'm 36 and a jack of all trades. I love coding and especially Linux, Blockchain tech and IOT.</p>
								<p>I'm have audited BSc Computer Science Maths and Electronics, but technically I'm a dropout. I tried to start a couple of startups but they failed. My career started as Tech Support at Dell. Had a short stint as German Editor at MacMillan, Bosch, but I hated the BPO and KPO industry. I went on to Middle East where I was a Software consultant. Then I became a Software Developer, Project Manager and Product Manager in Indian companies. Later I was part of two failed startups one in which I was Director of Tech and my own startup which we started with an Investor, but I quit that as we were not creating revolutionary stuff. I used to develop Android Sytem apps. One of my apps BusyBox X was a successful port of busybox linux, however I had sold of my portfolio.</p>
								<h2>Amiga 500</h2>
								<p>That's the machine which made me interested in Computers.</p>

					<!-- Risks -->

								<header class="major">
									<h2>Risks</h2>
									<p>Investing in idea stage projects can be risky. It could also be risky if you invest in crypto currencies and related projects if you do not understand the same. We are not yet a registered company. I am minimizing the risk to Investors by promising to do my best and not raising too much. In fact we are raising only a tiny fraction of what other companies are doing via ICO's. We are using a lean method and we plan to continue the ICO phase wise. Initially we need to make the POC and test it via a pilot. Other risks are that banking partners may not co-operate for allowing loading of AML and KYC compliant wallet. This issue we will work out once we are a registered company. There are also risks from third party security breach or hacking, however we take utmost care and secure and audit our computing infrastructure frequently.</p><p> During POC, a small quantity of coins + 30% for development are pre-mined to satisfy the investor from ICO. Some people may find it uncool, however this is needed in practice for successful delivery.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
							<section id="cta" class="main special">
								<header class="major">
									<h2>FAQ</h2>
									<p><h3>What technology stack are you using?</h3><br/>
									We use our own blockchain along with forked and modified versions of Parity and go ethereum. For end user applications we develop with golang mobile and kotlin. We also depend on cloud providers such as Google Compute Cloud to run our nodes.</p>


									<p><h3>Why another crypto currency?</h3><br/>
									Along with a crypto currency suite we are also developing our own crypto currency as it is pretty damn nearly impossible and or impractical to use bitcoins or ethereum here in India and Asia for the common man. And the exchange rate is high and few exchanges are available for bitcoins and ethereum. They are expensive to buy as exchanges charge a hefty margin which is counter to our philosophy. We can't bank the unbanked and unbank the banked this way!</p>
